# SQL-restaurant-analysis

We've been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well/ not well and what the top customers seem like best 

1. Exploring the menu_items table to get an idea of what is on the new menu
2. Exploring the order_details table to get and idea of the data that is been collected
3. Using both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu
